    "Aim: To create a Quantum Circuit Simulator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Features of the simulator: Support any single qubit Quantum gate  \n",
    "                                          Support for controlling any single qubit gate with arbitrary control and target qubits  \n",

    "                           \n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "Classically, n bits can be in one (and only one) of 2<sup>n</sup> states at any given time (since each bit can take 2 values: 0,1). Thus, n bits Classical information can be expressed with exactly n bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the quantum realm however, n qubits can be in a superposition of the 2<sup>n</sup> classical states. This means that the n bit representation we used for representing classical information is insufficient for expressing quantum information. Therefore, we need a system that represents the probability of getting all 2<sup>n</sup> states on measurement.  \n",
    "However, qubits have another trick up their sleeves- <b>Phase</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Qubits that produce the same result (with similar probabilities) on measurement could still be in different states. This is because of the phase in which the qubits exist.  \n",
    "Phase can be of 2 types: i) Local Phase  \n",
    "                                       ii) Global Phase   \n",
    "Global Phase does not usually affect how operators act on the qubits, but is essential for some algorithms such as Shor's algorithm (where we try to measure the global phase to estimate the period of modular exponentiation)  \n",
    "Local phase on the other hand is known to produce very intersting effects such as phase kickback, which is essential for the working of several quantum algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need a representation which incorporates both the probability as well as the phase of the (classical) states of the qubits. We use a vector representation called the statevector to express the present state of the system. Some important properties of statevectors are:\n",
    "* Since there are 2<sup>n</sup> possible states, the statevector is also 2<sup>n</sup> dimensional.  \n",
    "* Each complex entry in the statevector represents the amplitude if the state function in that state. The square of the modulus of the entry represents the probability of realizing that state on measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amplitudes can be altered using operators. Operators are unitary matrices which operate on the statevactor to alter the state amplitudes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will now explore these concepts further by creating our own Quantum Circuit Simulator!"
